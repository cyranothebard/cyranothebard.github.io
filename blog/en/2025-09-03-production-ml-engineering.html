<h1>Production ML Engineering: From Research Code to Reliable Systems</h1>
<p class="lead">Turning experimental notebooks into resilient, testable, and observable services.</p>

<p>We cover the patterns and checklists used to ship ML systems: configuration-driven pipelines, reproducible data processing, temporal validation, model registries, and serving patterns with observability. Examples draw on the Energy Recommendation System and Heart Failure Readmission projects.</p>

<h5>Key Practices</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Temporal evaluation and leakage prevention for time series.</li>
  <li>Typed interfaces between data, model, and serving layers.</li>
  <li>Monitoring: drift, data quality, latency, and error budgets.</li>
</ul>
