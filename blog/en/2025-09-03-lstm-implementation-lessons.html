<h1>LSTM Implementation Lessons: Multi-Output Forecasting at Team Scale</h1>
<p class="lead">What worked, what didnâ€™t, and how to keep complexity aligned with goals.</p>

<p>Building a multi-output LSTM for grid forecasting surfaced repeatable lessons: requirements-first design, temporal evaluation correctness, avoiding over-engineered attention patterns, and keeping interfaces clean for team collaboration.</p>

<h5>Key Lessons</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Specification clarity avoids accidental complexity.</li>
  <li>Temporal validation is non-negotiable for trustworthy metrics.</li>
  <li>Interfaces enable parallel work; premature optimization slows teams.</li>
</ul>
