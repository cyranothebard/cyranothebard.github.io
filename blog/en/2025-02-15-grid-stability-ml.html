        <h2>The Challenge of Renewable Energy Integration</h2>
        <p>The transition to renewable energy sources presents unprecedented challenges for power grid stability. Unlike traditional fossil fuel plants that provide consistent, predictable output, renewable sources like wind and solar are inherently variable and weather-dependent.</p>
        
        <p>This volatility creates several critical challenges:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Frequency Regulation:</strong> Maintaining grid frequency within ±0.1 Hz of 50 Hz (Europe) or 60 Hz (US)</li>
          <li><strong>Voltage Stability:</strong> Managing voltage fluctuations across the distribution network</li>
          <li><strong>Power Quality:</strong> Ensuring consistent power delivery to end consumers</li>
          <li><strong>Grid Congestion:</strong> Preventing overloads during peak renewable generation</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-4">
        <h2>System Architecture Overview</h2>
        <p>Our grid stabilization system employs a microservices architecture designed for high availability and real-time performance. The system consists of several key components:</p>
        
        <h5>Core Components</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data Ingestion Layer:</strong> Real-time collection of grid telemetry, weather data, and demand forecasts</li>
          <li><strong>ML Inference Engine:</strong> PyTorch-based models for load forecasting and grid optimization</li>
          <li><strong>Control System:</strong> Automated response mechanisms for grid stabilization</li>
          <li><strong>Monitoring & Alerting:</strong> Real-time dashboards and anomaly detection</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Technology Stack</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Backend:</strong> FastAPI with async/await for high-throughput API endpoints</li>
          <li><strong>ML Framework:</strong> PyTorch with ONNX optimization for production deployment</li>
          <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> PostgreSQL for metadata, Redis for real-time caching</li>
          <li><strong>Message Queue:</strong> Apache Kafka for high-throughput data streaming</li>
          <li><strong>Containerization:</strong> Docker with Kubernetes orchestration</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-4">
        <h2>Machine Learning Implementation</h2>
        <h5>LSTM Architecture for Load Forecasting</h5>
        <p>Our primary model uses a multi-layer LSTM architecture specifically designed for time-series forecasting:</p>
        
        <pre><code class="language-python">class GridLoadLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, output_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(
            input_size=input_size,
            hidden_size=hidden_size,
            num_layers=num_layers,
            dropout=0.3,
            batch_first=True,
            bidirectional=True
        )
        self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(hidden_size * 2, num_heads=8)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.3)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size * 2, output_size)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # LSTM processing
        lstm_out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        
        # Self-attention mechanism
        attn_out, _ = self.attention(
            lstm_out, lstm_out, lstm_out
        )
        
        # Global average pooling
        pooled = torch.mean(attn_out, dim=1)
        
        # Final classification
        out = self.dropout(pooled)
        return self.fc(out)</code></pre>

        <h5>Feature Engineering Pipeline</h5>
        <p>The feature engineering pipeline transforms raw grid data into model-ready features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Temporal Features:</strong> Hour, day, week, season, holidays, special events</li>
          <li><strong>Weather Features:</strong> Temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar irradiance</li>
          <li><strong>Grid Features:</strong> Current load, voltage levels, frequency, power factor</li>
          <li><strong>Economic Features:</strong> Energy prices, demand response signals, market conditions</li>
        </ul>
