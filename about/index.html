    <p class="lead">Senior Data Scientist focused on sustainable AI solutions for energy, healthcare, and manufacturing.</p>

    <div class="mb-3">
      <p><strong>Combining American technical innovation and German engineering precision: I bring systems thinking and a production focus to regulated, high-stakes industries with ambitious technical challenges.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
      <h3>Professional Journey</h3>
      <p>My path to data science leadership began with a simple realization: the most impactful technology bridges the gap between what's technically possible and what actually solves real problems. Starting as an automation engineer in US manufacturing, I learned to translate complex systems into measurable business value—a skill that became the foundation of everything that followed.</p>
      <p>As I evolved through analytics and data science roles, I discovered my strongest impact comes not just from building sophisticated models, but from orchestrating entire technical teams and stakeholder ecosystems around data-driven solutions. Whether designing IoT systems for manufacturing, optimizing healthcare data pipelines, or implementing NLP solutions for financial services, my focus remained consistent: connecting technical depth with strategic business outcomes.</p>
      <p>This trajectory naturally led me to Germany. The intersection of Europe's energy transition, Industry 4.0 initiatives, and the DACH region's commitment to engineering excellence creates unique opportunities for ML applications that demand both innovation and reliability. Having established my technical foundation in the US, I'm now strategically positioned to help German companies scale AI initiatives while meeting the quality and compliance standards that define success in European markets.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
      <h3>Why the DACH Market?</h3>
      <p>My relocation to Germany represents more than a geographic change—it's a strategic career decision driven by market opportunity and personal commitment. Germany's leadership in renewable energy and industrial automation creates demand for ML engineers who can bridge Silicon Valley innovation with German engineering rigor.</p>
      <p>Based in the Bodensee region, I'm positioned at the intersection of three major tech ecosystems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Munich</strong>: Bavaria's AI and automotive innovation hub</li>
        <li><strong>Zurich</strong>: Swiss fintech and precision engineering</li>
        <li><strong>Stuttgart/Konstanz</strong>: Industrial automation and manufacturing technology</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This tri-national corridor offers unique perspectives on how American technical approaches can adapt to European market requirements and regulatory frameworks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
      <h3>Technical Leadership Philosophy</h3>
      <p>I've built my career on the principle that successful ML systems require more than excellent algorithms—they demand clear stakeholder communication, systematic risk management, and architectures that scale with business growth. My approach combines:</p>
