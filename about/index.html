      <h3>Professional Background</h3>
      <p>I've built my career at the intersection of data science and practical problem-solving, evolving from implementing technical solutions to orchestrating them for measurable business impact. My journey began in automation engineering, where I learned to translate complex technical concepts into tangible value for manufacturers. As I progressed through analytics and data science roles, I discovered my greatest impact comes from connecting technical possibilities with business needs and guiding cross-functional teams toward innovative solutions.</p>
      <p>My experience designing IoT systems, optimizing healthcare data pipelines, and implementing NLP solutions has given me both technical depth and the ability to communicate across organizational boundaries. While I enjoy the technical challenges of data science, I find the most satisfaction when focusing on the why behind the technology—understanding user needs, aligning stakeholders, and designing solutions that deliver measurable impact. Emerging from graduate studies, I’m preparing to enter the DACH labor market with a focus on roles that leverage a strong technical foundation while emphasizing strategic thinking and collaborative leadership.</p>
